  - 'Holy ****, you''re awake! Walk around a bit need to make sure you can walk. '
  - Good, now jump over that rubble!
  - 'Well, we know you''re good at listening. Now you need to get to the elevator,
    to do that, you need to open that door. Look for a button. '
  - 'Well ****, you''re trapped. Well it was nice taking to you.....WAIT! GRAVITY!
    I can change the gravity, well I mean you can now. Give it a try. '
  - There you go, it works depending upon where you are looking. So forwards is always
    forwards, I thought it might be a little less confusing when using it in a pinch.
    :D
  - 'Becareful! Their is a turret in there. You''re pistol will take it out but shooting
    the barrel will be quicker. Try turning the gravity upside down when the barrel
    is about to explode. '
  - 'Great! Now that turret was faulty, so it was firing slowly. This next room has
    more turrets which are fully functional. Lucky for you maintenance uses a button
    on the ceiling to deacivate all in that room. Its glowing red on the ceiling you
    can''t miss it. Press it to deactivate the turrets or destroy them. Either works,
    it up to you. '
  - 'Anyway while you''re doing that, the ship was boarded by PIRATES. They have been
    slowly making their way throughout the ship but, due to its size, have only started
    to breach into the lower levels, which is where you still are by the way, so you
    might see some. Also they hacked the turrets if you''re wondering why they are
    attacking you. '
  - 'Did you get any of that? '
  - Great, the elevator is a pile of rubble as well. Take that key and look for a
    ventilation shaft.
